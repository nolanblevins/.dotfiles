# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.
## bashrc_custom
This is a custom configuration for bash containing a few aliases such as
cdd for the command "cd .." and lsa for "ls -a". This configuration also contains
a function that simplifies zipping a file using tar and unzipping a file with tar.
## vimrc
this is my custom configuration for vim which enables syntax, ruler as well as changes the
color scheme. This config also changes a few syntactical things such as shift width and soft tab stops.
